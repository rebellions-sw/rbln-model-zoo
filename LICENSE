    (b) Licensor will not be responsible or liable to Licensee, or deemed in default or
    breach hereunder by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations

    embargo, natural disaster, acts of God, flood, fire, sabotage, fluctuations or
    non-availability of electrical power, heat, light, air conditioning, or Licensee

    beyond Licensor's reasonable control.

    (c) This Agreement, together with all annexes, schedules, and exhibits attached hereto

    in its sole discretion. For purposes of the preceding sentence, and without limiting
    its generality, any merger, consolidation, or reorganization involving Licensee

    to be a transfer of rights, obligations, or performance under this Agreement for which
    Licensor's prior written consent is required. No delegation or other transfer will
    relieve Licensee of any of its obligations or performance under this Agreement.
    Any purported assignment, delegation, or transfer in violation of this Section is void.

    successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended
    to or shall confer on any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit, or remedy
    of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

    (f) No waiver by any party of any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless
    explicitly set forth in writing and signed by the party so waiving. Except as otherwise
    set forth in this Agreement, no failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any right,
    remedy, power, or privilege arising from this Agreement shall operate or be construed
    as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy,
    power, or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
    exercise of any other right, remedy, power, or privilege.

    (g) If any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in
    any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect
    any other term or provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable
    such term or provision in any other jurisdiction.
